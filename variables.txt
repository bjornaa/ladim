Different kind of variables
===========================

particle instance = particle at a given time


Particle variables:
-------------------

var = function(pid)
depend on the particle, not time

Instance variables:
-------------------

var = function(instance) = function(pid, time)
depend on the particle instance
Note: the two projections, pid and time are instance variables
Do not use time as such, but pid all the way
(pid is also a trivial and not useful particle variable)

state variables:
describes the physical model state
pid, X, Y, Z

position variables:
X, Y, Z
(include lon, lat?)

ibm_variables:
variables used by the IBM, can be both instance and particle
examples:
lat, initial size, size, temp, ...
Some of these are state variables, describing biological state,
forcing or deduced from forcing (e.g. density)

forcing variables:
U, V, W (velocity components, also reserved)
temp, salt,  ... IBM forcing
lon, lat, time, ... Helpers
some particle variables (initial size?)



release variables:
variables given to the particle by the rls file
pid, position, release time, initial size, super count, ...

output variables:
variables written to output
Must include pid

reserved variable names:
instance: pid, X, Y, Z, lon, lat, temp, salt
particle: release_time, release_X, release_Y, release_Z
(could predefine NetCDF format)
