Instantaneous line source
-------------------------

A line of particles are released simultaneously
at fixed depth.

---------

After installing ladim, the example can be run as:

> python make_release.py

This produces the particle release file line.in

> ladim

This runs the particle tracking

> python animate.py

This shows a simple animation of the results

Tweak make_release.py for the initial condition
and ladim.yaml for the run

--------

The example forcing consist of 3-days averages from a North
Sea downscaling (Ådlandsvik and Bentsen, 2007)
The forcing file is available as ...
Alternatively any ROMS history or average file should be suitable.
