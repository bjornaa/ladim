Geographical coordinates
=========================

This is example demonstrates the use of geographical coordinates with
``LADiM``. A line of particles is released along the 59Â° parallel from Scotland
to Norway.

Presently particle release positions are only accepted in grid coordinates. As
the release file is typically made by a ``make_release`` script, this script
can handle the conversion. This is done here, using a method ``ll2xy`` of the
``Grid`` class in the ``gridforce`` module.

For output, the ``ladim.yaml`` file shows how to write longitude and latitude.
Basically, add "lon" and "lat" to the list of output instance variables and
make sure they have the necessary arguments.

The plot scripts, ``plot_basemap.py`` and ``plot_cartopy.py``, demonstrates
ways of plotting the particle distributions in these mapping packages for
``matplotlib``.

The plotting above is slow. This is mainly due to the time used in handling the
intermediate resolution coast line. This may be speeded up several times by
using a pre-made coast line. The script ``make_coast.py`` uses ``basemap`` to
extract the coast line and saves it to ``coast.npy``. The new scripts
``plot2_basemap.py`` and ``plot2_cartopy.py`` are then several times faster.
