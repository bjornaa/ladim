:mod:grid --- The ladim grid module
===================================

The grid module defines the coordinate system and provide methods for
interfacing the grid.

Horizontal coordinate system
----------------------------

The coordinate system should be curvilinear orthogonal. Grids as used by
ROMS for instance are suitable. The coordinates should have integer values at
the grid cell centers. [Necessary, or a detail left to the implementation?]

The grid spacing is given by metric coefficients :math:`\Delta x` and
:math:`\Delta y`
(sjekk at de brukes rett). For a ROMS grid these can be read from a
grid file as the inverses of pm amd pn.
For a lon/lat grid on a sphere they are given as

.. math:: \Delta x = R \cos \phi \Delta\lambda, \quad \Delta y = R \Delta\phi

where :math:`R` is the earth radius, :math:`\lambda` and :math:`\phi` are the
longitude and latitude in radians.

Vertical coordinate system
--------------------------

The vertical coordinate system is simply the depth in meters, with positive
values downwards.

:class:`grid`
-------------

The grid is defined by a class having the following public **attributes**.

``imax``, ``jmax``
    Number of grid cells in X and Y direction (needed outside?)
``H``
    The bathymetry [meters]
``M``
    Sea mask (= 1 at sea, = 0 at land)

And a set of **methods**, taking positional arrays ``X``, ``Y`` as input

``sample_metric(X, Y)``
    returns :math:`\Delta x` and  :math:`\Delta y` at the positions
``sample_depth(X, Y)``
    returns the depth at the positions
``lonlat(X, Y)``
    returns lon/lat of positions [degrees]
``ingrid(X, Y)``
    returns True for positions inside the grid
``atsea(X, Y)``
    returns True for positions at sea (not on land)
