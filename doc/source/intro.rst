Introduction
============

LADIM is the acronym of the Lagrangian Advection and DIffusion Model.

It is an offline ocean particle tracking model. Presently it takes
input from the `ROMS <http://www.myroms.org>`_ ocean model.
This can easily be extended to other models
by writing new forcing modules.

The model represents a continuation of the old LADIM fortran codes at
the `Institute of Marine Research <http://www.imr.no>`_.
The new code is written in `python <https://www.python.org>`_ (python 3 only).
