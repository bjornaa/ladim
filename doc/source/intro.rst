Introduction
============

LADIM is the acronym of the Lagrangian Advection and DIffusion Model.

It is an offline ocean particle tracking model. Presently it takes
input from the ROMS ocean model. This can easily be extended to other models
by writing new forcing modules.

The model represents a continuation of the old LADIM fortran codes at
the institute of Marine Research. The new code is written in python
(python 3 only).
