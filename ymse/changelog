Improved the ROMS gridforce module.

Fixed a bug where files in a sequence of forcing files
were not closed properly.
NetCDF attributes scale_factor and add_offset are now
read individually for forcing files in a sequence.

Added active flag for particles.

Particles have logical flags alive and active.
If alive is False, the particle is not moved, and will be removed.
If alive is True and active is False, the particle is not moved
but will remain and can be activated later.
TODO: clear up about output.
