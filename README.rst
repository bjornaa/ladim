pyladim
=======

This is a pyhon prototype of the Lagrangian Advection and DIffusion Model,
an off-line particle tracking code using results
from the ocean model `ROMS <http://www.myroms.org/>`_ as input.

Try out pyladim
---------------

Presently the model depends on the package `roppy
<https://code.google.com/p/roppy/>`_ for handling input from ROMS.

It also needs an example input data file. From the pyladim download
area at bitbucket download and gunzip the ROMS netCDF file
`ocean_avg_0014.nc.gz` into the pyladim/input directory.

A particle init file is generated by typing python makeini.py
in the pyladim/prepro directory. Change back to the main pyladim
directory and type ladim to run the model.

The results can be viewed using the scripts in pyladim/postpro.
