Overview of the pyladim program
===============================

Pyladim is (presently) a pure python particle tracking code 
for offline use based on output from the ROMS ocean model.



The horizontal coordinates used are ROMS grid coordinates.
(continuous X, Y s.t. X = i and Y = j in the center of
grid cell (i,j)). The land mask is taken directly from ROMS.
In the vertical, depth is used as a coordinate. A full version
handle input/output in longitude/latitude.

The data structure is simple. The model state is described by a class
`State`, with float32 numpy arrays `X`, `Y`, `Z` for the particle
positions, and integer arrays `pid` and `start` for the particle
identifier (particle counter) and start time. The forcing is in a 
class `ROMS_input` which holds and updates the 3D velocity arrays
(in native staggered grid with s-coordinates).


The main program is called `ladim`. It starts by reading a
configuration or setup file. Thereafter it initalizes the 
`State`, `ROMS_input`, and `OutPut` instances.
The main time loop has the following steps::

  - Update the forcing
  - Add new particles, if needed
  - Write to file, if needed
  - Move the particles 
  - Add any behaviour (i.e. vertical migration)

Mulig svakhet: Skriver ut initial state OK men ikke final state, må ta et
ekstra tidsteg for å få dette med.

The movement is done by functions in `trackpart.py`. In the prototype
only the simple Euler-Forward advection method is provided. Higher
order advection schemes (Runge Kutta 4th order) and random walk
diffusion can easily be added. The routine(s) in trackpart calls 
sample-functions in `sample_roms.py` to linearly interpolate the fields
to the particle positions.

ROMS-avhengigheten er i klassen `ROMS_input` og sample-funksjonene i 
`sample_roms.py` (de siste burde vært metoder i klassen). For å bruke
andre modeller må en lage tilsvarende klasse for hver modell.


Design
------

A cleaner version of the design (not identical to the actual
prototype, not complete) can be summed up by the following classes::

  class State
  
  particle_identifier
  X, Y, Z
  start_time
  (all 1D numpy arrays over active particles)
  
  update            # This is the real particle tracking
  seed_particles
  remove_particles
  summary           # returns string with summary information
  
  # --------------------

  class Forcing   # with subclasses like ROMS_Forcing
  
  U, V, W, ...
  (1D numpy arrays sampled at particle positions)
  
  update
  (different update methods for different models
   includes reading files and interpolation)

  # -------------------

  class Setup

  timestep
  start_time
  stop_time
  nsteps      # number of time steps
  grid_file
  input_file
  particle_release_file
  output_period          
  output_file
  output_variables  # List

  readsup   # read configuration file
  writesup  

  # -------------------------

  class Grid  #  with subclasses ROMS_Grid and so on

  mask        # sea mask

  ll2grid     # lon/lat -> grid coordinates
  grid2ll     # grid coordinates -> lon/lat

  # -------------------------
  
  class ParticleReleaser

  particle_counter
  next_release_step  

  read_particles     # read time and location of release 

  # -------------------------

  class OutPut

  nc_type     # nc_type['X'] = 'f4' etc
  nc_attr     # nc_attr['X']['long_name'] = 'grid X-coordinate' etc

  write       # write the state 
  close       # close the output file

  # --------------------------

  class Ladim  # Main program

  setup_file        # Configuration file
  timestep_counter 
  
  inititiate_state
  initiate_forcing
  initiate_output   # Define the netCDF file
  
  next      # making it a python iterator, return timestep_counter
  __iter__   
  clean_up     # Final clean-up


The main program will be a script that could look something like::

  model = Ladim(setup_file)

  model.initiate_state()  # These could be part of the __init__ 
  model.initiate_forcing()
  model.initiate_output()

  for stepnr in model:
      model_time = stepnr * model.setup.dt
      if model_time % 86400 == 0:
          # Daily summary
          print model.state.summary()

  model.clean_up()
